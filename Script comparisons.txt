#. How to Compare Numbers, Strings and Files in Bash Shell Script.

#####-->Numeric Comparisons:-

num1 -eq num2                  check if 1st  number is equal to 2nd number
num1 -ge num2                  checks if 1st  number  is greater than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -gt num2                  checks if 1st  number is greater than 2nd number
num1 -le num2                   checks if 1st number is less than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -lt num2                   checks if 1st  number  is less than 2nd number
num1 -ne num2                  checks if 1st  number  is not equal to 2nd number

#####-->Strings Comparisons:-

var1 = var2     checks if var1 is the same as string var2
var1 != var2    checks if var1 is not the same as var2
var1 < var2     checks if var1 is less than var2
var1 > var2     checks if var1 is greater than var2
-n var1             checks if var1 has a length greater than zero
-z var1             checks if var1 has a length of zero


#####-->File comparison :-

-d file                        checks if the file exists and is it’s a directory
-e file                        checks if the file exists on system
-w file                       checks if the file exists on system and if it is writable
-r file                        checks if the file exists on system and it is readable
-s file                        checks if the file exists on system and it is not empty
-f file                         checks if the file exists on system and it is a file
-O file                       checks if the file exists on system and if it’s is owned by the current user
-G file                        checks if the file exists and the default group is the same as the current user
-x file                         checks if the file exists on system and is executable
file A -nt file B         checks if file A is newer than file B
file A -ot file B          checks if file A is older than file B



==> Syntax for doing comparisons:-
 
 if [ conditions/comparisons]
    then
         commands
fi

if [2 -gt 3]
     then
     print "2 is greater"
     else
     print "2 is not greater"
fi

==> Now that we know all the parameters that are used 
    for numeric comparisons, let’s use these in a script,:-
	
#!/bin/bash
# Script to do numeric comparisons
var1=10
var2=20
if [ $var2 -gt $var1 ]
    then
        echo "$var2 is greater than $var1"
fi
# Second comparison
If [ $var1 -gt 30]
    then
        echo "$var is greater than 30"
    else
        echo "$var1 is less than 30"
fi

==>  Now let’s create a script doing the string comparisons:-

#!/bin/bash
# Script to do string equality comparison
name=linuxtechi
if [ $USER = $name ]
        then
                echo "User exists"
        else
                echo "User not found"
fi
# script to check string comparisons
var1=a
var2=z
var3=Z
if [ $var1 \> $var2 ]
        then
                echo "$var1 is greater"
        else
                echo "$var2 is greater"
fi
# Lower case  & upper case comparisons
if [ $var3 \> $var1 ]
        then
                echo "$var3 is greater"
        else
                echo "$var1 is greater"
fi

==> We will now be creating another script that will use “-n” & “-z” 
   with strings to check if they hold any value:-
 
#!/bin/bash
# Script to see if the variable holds value or not
var1=" "
var2=linuxtechi
if [ -n $var1 ]
        then
                echo "string  is not empty"
        else
                echo "string provided is empty"
fi

==>  Here is a script using the file comparison;-

#!/bin/bash
# Script to check file comparison
dir=/home/linuxtechi
if [ -d $dir ]
        then
                echo "$dir is a directory"
                cd $dir
                ls -a
        else
                echo "$dir is not exist"
fi
